// In object-oriented programming, a class B can extend or subclass another class A. We
// say that A is the superclass and B is the subclass. Instances of B inherit the methods of
// A. The class B can define its own methods, some of which may override methods of
// the same name defined by class A. If a method of B overrides a method of A, the
// overriding method in B often needs to invoke the overridden method in A. Similarly,
// the subclass constructor B() must typically invoke the superclass constructor A() in
// order to ensure that instances are completely initialized.
